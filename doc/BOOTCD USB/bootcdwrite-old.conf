# If booted from initrd bootcd has to load the necessary modules.

# specify "standard" here. If bootcd should try extra hard to load 
# neccessary modules you can specify "bootcd" here. 
# Bootcd will use discover for this purpose. So discover has to be installed.
# If you specify auto, bootcd will check if discover is installed. 
# If it is installed # BOOTCDMODPROBE=bootcd will be set, if not 
# BOOTCDMODPROBE=standard will be set.
# Be aware that people have reported, that sometimes BOOTCDMODPROBE=bootcd 
# may not work but sometimes it is needed.
